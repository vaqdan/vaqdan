Hi, I'm Dani, a Computer Engineering student at Universidad Nacional de Educaci√≥n a Distancia (UNED). I'm passionate about programming and I'm excited to share my projects and learn from others.

I'm currently focused on my studies, but I enjoy working on personal and university projects. You can find some of them here on GitHub.
